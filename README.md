> A visualization of Hoodie Community Activity

The Hoodie Community Dashboard is a project to visualise activity including workload, active contributors, and maintainers over time. The Dashboard is currently a work-in-progress: [#102](https://github.com/hoodiehq/camp/issues/102).

## Current Status
To visualize data from GitHub activity, we are implementing Chart.js on the front-end and Hapi as the API server. This repository holds the front-end files. The repository holding server files can be accessed at: [hoodie-community-dashboard-api](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie-community-dashboard-api).
